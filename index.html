                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Sushi Passion was opened by the owner Shirou Yamaoka in 1988. Shirou is the son of Yuzan Kaibara, who is the chairman of "Bishoku Club". "Bishoku Club," which literally means "A club for pursuing the supreme taste," is known all over Japan for its strong passion for Japanese traditional cuisine. Sushi Passion was named after this history.</p>
                <h3>What is "Bishoku Club"?</h3>
                <p>Bishoku Club was established in 1950 by Yuzan Kaibara, who is a front runner in the food industry in Japan. Yuzan wanted to prevent Japanese food culture from being put aside by western food culture, which was convenient and cheap for everyone.</p>
